# Laptops-prices-regression-end-to-end

### Problem Definition
Predict, based on many laptop features, a laptop price.
### Data
This dataset is a collection of features related to various laptops, such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage capacity, and other specifications. The dataset also includes the corresponding prices of these laptops. This dataset can be used for regression analysis to predict the prices of laptops based on their features. The dataset is suitable for data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, and researchers who are interested in building regression models to predict the prices of laptops based on various features.

The dataset used can be found on Kaggle using the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anubhavgoyal10/laptop-prices-dataset

### Goal

> We aim to achieve an RMSE value as close to zero as possible.

### Evaluation Metric
For the proper evaluation we gonna calculate:
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R-squared (RÂ²) Score
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

By using them we'll gain insights into different aspects of model predictions.
